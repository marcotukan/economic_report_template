# Tukan Economic Opportunity Report Template

This is a proposal for the possible content that our economic opportunity report could have.

First and most important, we must provide information for the specific industry of interest. We should provide information that enables the user to make inferences on the market structure (supply and demand). Secondly, we must provide a general picture about Mexico, or the relateded entities, regarding institutional and economical aspects related to the industry or product. Finally we could add a third chapter with our recommendations, predictions, forecasts, inhouse demand and supply models, visualizations( for example aa traffic light graph depending on the ease of starting a business in that particular industry)

For this, we have enough data for the general economic and institutional picture, we have some data on market sctructure and very few data for the specific demand and supply for industry/product. So in order to continue a project like this we will need to increase our data catalogue in wide and depth:

+ add more tables related supply and demand data for different products and industries
+ create more secondary tables of interest for each industry or product
+ desagregate the most possible some of the tables we already have (for example trade balance, economic activities etc)
+ create or adapt a system like SCIAN that enables us to relate tables, references and indicators in a hierachical way between products, industries etc.
